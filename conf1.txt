wallpost user5 "The correct way to punctuate a sentence that starts: \"Of course it is none of my business, but --\" is to place a period after the word \"but.\" Don't use excessive force in supplying such a moron with a period.

wallpost user1 "Best Mistakes In Films 	In his \"Filgoer's Companion\", Mr. Leslie Halliwell helpfully lists four of the cinema's greatest moments which you should get to see if at all possible. 	In \"Carmen Jones\", the camera tracks with Dorothy Dandridge down a street; and the entire film crew is reflected in the shop window. 	In \"The Wrong Box\", the roofs of Victorian London are emblazoned with television aerials. 	In \"Decameron Nights\", Louis Jourdain stands on the deck of his fourteenth century pirate ship; and a white lorry trundles down the hill in the background. 	In \"Viking Queen\", set in the times of Boadicea, a wrist watch is clearly visible on one of the leading characters. 		-- Stephen Pile, \"The Book of Heroic Failures\""

wallpost user1 "The IRS spends God knows how much of your tax money on these toll-free information hot lines staffed by IRS employees, whose idea of a dynamite tax tip is that you should print neatly.  If you ask them a real tax question, such as how you can cheat, they're useless.  So, for guidance, you want to look to big business.  Big business never pays a nickel in taxes, according to Ralph Nader, who represents a big consumer organization that never pays a nickel in taxes... 		-- Dave Barry, \"Sweating Out Taxes\""
